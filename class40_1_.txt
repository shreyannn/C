Random file access in c: 
We have three different inbuilt C functions for random file access:

1. fseek (file, no of bytes to skip, position of file pointer)   -> changes the position of file pointer.
   0 -> beginning of file.
   1 -> current file pointer position.
   2 -> end of file.

2. ftell(file)   
   it returns the location/ position of file pointer.

3. rewind   
   it sets file pointer position to beginning of file.
